# Rikou

Formerly the bot from the Schwarzfuchs, now GameCentral discord server.
Bad code with even worse insider jokes.


Rikou is a simple, multi-purpose discord bot with server specific features.
Its pointless to invite this bot to your server, but you can use this as template for your own bot.

Developed by Maevisss (main developer), LeTak (the better eveloper), and Panzerband1337 (I just want the badge inactive developer).
